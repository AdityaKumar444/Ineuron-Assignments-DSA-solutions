DSA Circular linked list

1. Given a circular doubly linked list and a position n. The task is to delete the node at
the given position n from the beginning. Initial circular doubly linked list.

2. Given a sorted circular doubly linked list of distinct nodes(no two nodes have the
same data) and a value x. Count triplets in the list that sum up to a given value x.

3. Given a doubly singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not.

4. Given a circular linked list, count the number of nodes in it.

5. Given a doubly linked list, we have to convert it into a circular linked list.
Time Complexity: O(n), As we need to move through the whole list to get hold of the
last node.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), As constant extra space is used.

6. Given two circular linked lists L1 and L2, the task is to find if the two circular linked
lists are identical or not.

7. Given a circular singly linked list containing N nodes, the task is to delete all the odd
nodes from the list.

8. Given a circular doubly-linked list, find the largest node in the doubly linked list.

9. Given a circular doubly linked list containing n nodes. The problem is to reverse
every group of k nodes in the list.

10. Write a program to reverse the given circular Doubly Linked List.
